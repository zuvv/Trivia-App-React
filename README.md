# Trivia App Built in React ðŸ§ 
Welcome to my Trivia App, crafted with React! ðŸš€
All the intriguing questions are curated and stored in a CSV file, then transformed into a JSON format.

## Getting Started
Initial start of the app shows History.
Updating the category resets the Questions.
All questions are selected randomly and questions are not asked twice.

### Instructions for Updating the Public Branch with Build File
1. Start by branching off: `git checkout -b public`
2. Silence the build in `.gitignore` within the public branch
3. Chronicle your progress with a commit: `git commit -am "Enable build inclusion"`
4. Nurture dependencies: `npm install`
5. Orchestrate the grand build: `npm run build`
6. Gather your changes: `git add -A`
7. Set sail for the distant shores of the public branch: `git subtree push --prefix build origin public`

### Publishing to GitHub Pages
1. Go to "Settings" (it looks like a gear icon).
2. Find and click on "Pages" (it looks like a book).
3. Choose the "public" branch as the main one.
4. Set the main folder as the root.
5. Don't forget to save your changes.

## HomePage Addition
Don't forget to add your homepage URL to your `package.json`:
```json
"homepage": "https://zuvv.github.io/Trivia-App-React/"
